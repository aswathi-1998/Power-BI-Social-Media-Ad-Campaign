# Social Media Ad Campaign analysis

An analysis of the effectiveness of social media ad campaigns using Power BI, showcasing campaign performance, ad effectiveness, and user engagement trends

## About the Data
The Data comprises of four datasets namely:
-	Campaigns – Campaign-level information (budget, duration, start/end dates) 
-	Ads – Ad details (platform, format, target audience, campaign linkage) 
-	Users – User demographics and interests 
-	Ad_Events – Logs of user interactions with ads (impressions, likes, shares)

To see data use the [kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alperenmyung/social-media-advertisement-performance/data)


## Key Findings and suggestions

-	Most people did not have much engagement with the ads. So better work needs to be done to gather more clicks and other forms of engagement
-	To get more engagement in terms of Clicks, Likes, Shares, Comments and Purchases, try posting ads preferably on Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays during the afternoon or evening timings.
-	 Most users and most engagement were by males, so more ads targeting that group can be used.
-	Most users and most engagement were by the age group of 25-34, so more ads targeting that group can be used.
-	There were some campaigns which did not have any ads (16 and 43) the reason for that must be investigated.
-	Most Engagements were derived from stories while least with long form video ads. Hence more emphasis should be given on that.
-	More number of ads can be expanded to Instagram as well. In fact same ads can be used in Facebook and Instagram to analyse which is the more responsive ad, rather than restricting a particular ad to a particular platform.
